# Simple CRUD using PHP & MySQL

This is my first ever complete project I create (although it's not perfect) about implementation of CRUD using **HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, and MYSQL**.

## Features

It's just a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) nothing special (yet).

## Motivation

I'm doing this project to fill the internship requirements.

## Prerequisite

To run this code you need:

- XAMPP

## Installation or Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/mhnaufal/simple-crud-php.git

or simply download the zip and extract it

2. Move the 'absen' directory to ./xampp/htdocs

3. Run the XAMPP

4. Open a web browser and go to

   localhost/absen/index.php

5. Enjoy :grin:
